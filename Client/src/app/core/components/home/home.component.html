   Typography is a way of arranging type to make text legible, readable, and appealing when displayed. Angular Material's typography
  is based on the guidelines from the Material Design spec and is arranged into typography levels. Each level has a font-size,
  line-height and font-weight. The available levels are: display-4, display-3, display-2 and display-1 - Large, one-off headers,
  usually at the top of the page (e.g. a hero header). headline - Section heading corresponding to the
levels are collected into a typography config which is used to generate the CSS.
